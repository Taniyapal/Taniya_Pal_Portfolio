# Taniya_Pal_Portfolio
Highlights of Data Analysis work done by Taniya Pal.

## HR_Attrition Project
Contains a Jupyter notebook and a .csv file. The jupyter notebook highlights the steps Taniya performed to analyse the .csv file "HR_Employee_Attrition_Data.csv". Taniya performed intial preprocessing steps
using Pandas library in Python and proceeded to perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries in Python.

## Cranfield University Projects
The folder contains the Data Analysis and ML projects, Taniya performed during her time at Cranfield University pursuing masters in Applied Bioinformatics (a subject similar to Data Sceince).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, Taniya had to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on given files. She had to perform tasks like ANOVA, PCA, different smoothing techniques, create histograms to visualise the data, create different plots for EDA. In her reoprt, she had to interpret all the graph she had produced with appropiate reasoning. the graphs and their interpretation can be found on the report file.

### Machine_Learning_for_Metabolomics

The project required to assess the performance of machine learning models such as classification model and regression model. She had to compare the perform of various machine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Random Forest. the performance metrics of the models can be found on the report file.
